# ephaptic-discordant-alternans

Determine the effect of ephaptic coupling on discordant alternans.

- Version history (in reverse chronological order):
    - Added the taem (twice-abbreviated ephaptic model) fiber model:
        * Still has a couple of flaws: 
            (1) xi is just given a value (should be calculated).
            (2) line colors are not consistent.
    - Changed local directory location.
    - Just starting this git-based project.  So, start by modeling the subcircuit representing the dynamics of wave propagation in the cleft region (between the cells).
